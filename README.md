# data-analysis and data science with python

Contains my projects which I have done during data science course

Prediction Projects: 
1. House prediction - contains linear regression for predicting house prices
2. Stock Prediction

3. Automobile price prediction - It is a complete data science project beginning from data-wrangling to exploratory data analysis and finally model building and decision making. The aim is to predict automobile prices given some attributes. It incorporates data cleaning, making a choice for important attributes, formatting attributes in a manner that can be incorporated to building a model and finally building multiple linear regression model and polynomial regression models and deciding which is better and hence, can be accepted model for predictions.

Clustering Projects

1. ImageClusterUsingKandOpenCV&Elbow - This project contains image clustering using K means and open CV. K means is found applying elbow method to pixel array. Then we also compare memory needed to save compressed image and original image.
